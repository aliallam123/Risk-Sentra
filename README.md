# Risk-Sentra
The aim of this project is to develop Risk Sentra; an AI-driven risk-analysis assistant for assurance engagements that integrates implicit-risk inference with audit-grade traceability and PwC's standardised risk taxonomy to produce a consolidated, source-linked risk register and a leadership-ready summary.
